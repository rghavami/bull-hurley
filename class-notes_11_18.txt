My Releases:
Development -> Staging -> Production
-If any single case or task within the deployment is rejected, the entire deployment will be marked as 'Rejected'.
This allows Zoomin to address any issues promptly.
-Once all tasks are complete, all cases will be closed, and the release will be marked as completed.
